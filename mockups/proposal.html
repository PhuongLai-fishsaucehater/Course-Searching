        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>
            It is difficult for students at the University of Washington to find out how specific courses are structured. This is a problem because many students struggle with choosing courses that align with their interests and preferences. There is not currently an organized resource to find information about the course structure and grading style of classes at the University of Washington. This makes it difficult for students to find reliable information about course structures, leading them to instead rely on biased user-submitted reviews of professors on <a href="https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2675588">other websites</a>. One previous attempt at a similar resource is <a href="https://dawgpath.uw.edu/">DawgPath</a> from UW-IT, a website where students can look up for the grade distribution of classes and the prerequisite classes. The website gives students a high-level view of the course before they register for the class. It also helps students choose between classes based on reviews. However, it does not provide any information regarding how the class functions.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            The users would be students at the University of Washington. They will be the ones accessing and providing the information to the website. The users would be viewing information that is collected by other students at the University of Washington. We want the users to be able to provide information on the classes from their own experience taking the class. This isnâ€™t reviews of the class but rather data on the course structure, grading style, and how the class works overall. Since the class structure changes based on the professor teaching it we want to collect data for a class with a variety of ways the class was taught so students can filter it to the professor they would take the class with to get the most relevant information. The users would be able to view all the collected information about any class at the University of Washington on our website. They will be able to enter in the class that they want the information on as well as the professor and the website would display that to the user. There will also be a class finder part of the website where students will be able to filter the user collected data to a list of classes based on their entered criteria. This would include things like a professor they want to take a class with, if the class has a midterm or final, if the class is mostly group work, if the homework is graded for completion, if there are weekly quizzes, amount of homework in the class, how many credits, etc. This way students will have an easier way of finding classes to take as well as having a better way to find useful information on the classes and their structure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our app will be able to solve this problem by providing a clear and transparent course structure including the syllabus and grading styles form different professors at the University of Washington. Our data is collected from Students who are currently enrolled in the class, therefore, users will be able to see an accurate structure of the courses that they want to take.
